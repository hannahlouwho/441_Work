          <div class="black"><p style="text-align:center;">Hiya! Who am I? I am your every day
          kitty loving, bubbly blonde, explorer, mixed with sugar, spice,
          and something nice on the rocks.</p>

          <p style="text-align:center;">I grew up in Big Timber Montana. Where the
          Crazy Mountains are and the friendly people grow.
          Coming from a small town has taught me two very important lessons. One, If you
          tell the cop that pulled you over for speeding that
          your momma is expecting you home in 2 minutes he will send you on your way
          with a warning, and two, there is no place like Montana.</p>

          <p style="text-align:center;"> My hobbies are an array of everything to lounging
          on my couch with my kitty to cliff jumping hundred foot declines.
          I am really big in to the outdoors, so much so that my summer job is camping
          fifty hours a week! Along with being outdoors almost permanently I love photography
          and have made a small business out of it. I am hoping to make it a career one day.</p>

          <p style="text-align:center;"> I am planning on graduating this semester and scoring
          a management position at the resort that I work at. The position I am aiming for is a
          very untraditional management position, which makes it my dream job. The second reason
          for it being my dream job is due to how much time I would get to spend outside. As I
          previously mentioned, I LOVE THE OUTDOORS. Thirdly, I will have the opportunity to combine
          my talents of the service industry and working with couples. The position entails working
          solely with newly weds, second third or fourth honeymooners, romantic gettawayers, or
          just becausers. I plan to take everything I have learned in college, my wedding involvment,
          and the service industry and apply it to this position. Fingers crossed! </p>
