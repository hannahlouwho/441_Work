        <h1>Homework #3</h1>

        <p>When I first started this assignment I had a big idea of what I wanted to do. Then as I was working and pulling ideas and code from the internet I realized I was in over my head. I kept confusing myself and getting what I was trying to do extremely mixed up and I kept losing track of what parts of the story was supposed to go where.</p>

        <p>So, I decided to go back to the basics and stick with a very simple design and plan so I was not confusing myself further. I beleive it turned out great, however I would like to expand on this idea! </p>
