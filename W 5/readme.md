        # Homework 5

This week was okay. I am having trouble with the padding and margins of the
table. I think its fixed and I cant figure out how to undo that. Hopefully I
can soon. Just as well I think it looks alright besides that technical
difficuty! I did reference Cassens' example code. Hopefully, not too much!
I do like some of my stylings. They turned out better than I had origionally
planned. I kinda just picked a couple colors and went with it. I was also
origionally going to do this with babies....but since I am a cat mom I
decided the kitties were funnier.
