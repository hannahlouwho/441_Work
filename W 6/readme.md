        # Homework 5

I am still having trouble with the padding and margins of the
table. I am probably going to have to go in to fix this issue.
Just as well I think it looks alright besides that technical
difficuty! I did reference Cassens' example code. Hopefully, not too much!
I do like some of my stylings. They turned out better than I had origionally
planned last week. I kinda just picked a couple colors and went with it. I was also
origionally going to do this game with babies....but since I am a kitty mom I
decided the kitties were funnier.
