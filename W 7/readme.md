        # Homework 7

I first started with a super complicated code and I kept getting confused on what was supposed to link to what and I basically made a huge coding mess. So I started over completely from scratch. From there the assignment was pretty easy. I used the basics from the course website and looked at some other classmates code examples on github then I and plugged in what I wanted everything to look like. However with both my frist and second draft, I am having a lot of trouble getting my images to actually appear... I have looked over the assignment several times and I cant figure what I am doing wrong. I plan to come in and fix this issue.
