## Week 9/10
Hannah Wheeler

# Work Cycle
---
This was actually really difficult for me. I started over several times and
completely scrapped what I was working on several times and referenced a lot of
other students work. I also worked ahead into week 10 since I was so confused
and wanted to just do the final product rather than two halfs.

# Successes
---
I was at least able to produce info when it is called on by the methods.
But only with Html so far


# Difficulties
---
I cant get the information to produce in AJAX, and JSON
